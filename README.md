gist(1) -- upload code to https://gist.github.com
=================================================

## Synopsis

The gist gem provides a `gist` command that you can use from your terminal to
upload content to https://gist.github.com/.

## Installation

* If you have ruby installed:

    gem install gist

* If you're using Bundler:

    source :rubygems
    gem 'gist'

* For OS X, `gist` lives in Homebrew

    brew install gist

* For FreeBSD, `gist` lives in ports

    pkg install gist

* For Ubuntu/Debian, `gist` has been renamed to `gist-paste` to avoid a name conflict

    apt install gist

## Command

* To upload the contents of `a.rb` just:

    gist a.rb

* Upload multiple files:

    gist a b c
    gist *.rb

* By default it reads from STDIN, and you can set a filename with `-f`.

    gist -f test.rb <a.rb

* Alternatively, you can just paste from the clipboard:

    gist -P

* Use `-p` to make the gist private:

    gist -p a.rb

* Use `-d` to add a description:

    gist -d "Random rbx bug" a.rb

* You can update existing gists with `-u`:

    gist -u GIST_ID FILE_NAME
    gist -u 42f2c239d2eb57299408 test.txt

* If you'd like to copy the resulting URL to your clipboard, use `-c`.

    gist -c <a.rb

* If you'd like to copy the resulting embeddable URL to your clipboard, use `-e`.

    gist -e <a.rb

* And you can just ask gist to open a browser window directly with `-o`.

    gist -o <a.rb

* To list (public gists or all gists for authed user) gists for user

    gist -l : all gists for authed user
    gist -l defunkt : list defunkt's public gists

* To read a gist and print it to STDOUT

    gist -r GIST_ID
    gist -r 374130

* See `gist --help` for more detail.

## Login

Before you use `gist` for the first time you will need to log in. There are two supported login flows:

1. The Github device-code Oauth flow. This is the default for authenticating to github.com, and can be enabled for Github Enterprise by creating an Oauth app, and exporting the environment variable `GIST_CLIENT_ID` with the client id of the Oauth app.
2. The (deprecated) username and password token exchange flow. This is the default for GitHub Enterprise, and can be used to log into github.com by exporting the environment variable `GIST_USE_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD`.

### The device-code flow

This flow allows you to obtain a token by logging into GitHub in the browser and typing a verification code. This is the preferred mechanism.

    gist --login
    Requesting login parameters...
    Please sign in at https://github.com/login/device
      and enter code: XXXX-XXXX
    Success! https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e

The returned `access_token` is stored in `~/.gist` and used for all future gisting.  If you need to you can revoke access from  https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e.

### The username-password flow

This flow asks for your GitHub username and password (and 2FA code), and exchanges them for a token with the "gist" permission (your username and password are not stored). This mechanism is deprecated by GitHub, but may still work with GitHub Enterprise.

    gist --login
    Obtaining OAuth2 access_token from GitHub.
    GitHub username: ConradIrwin
    GitHub password:
    2-factor auth code:
    Success! https://github.com/settings/tokens

This token is stored in `~/.gist` and used for all future gisting. If you need to
you can revoke it from https://github.com/settings/tokens, or just delete the
file.

### Password-less login

If you have a complicated authorization requirement you can manually create a
token file by pasting a GitHub token with `gist` scope (and maybe the `user:email`
for GitHub Enterprise) into a file called `~/.gist`. You can create one from
https://github.com/settings/tokens

This file should contain only the token (~40 hex characters), and to make it
easier to edit, can optionally have a final newline (`\n` or `\r\n`).

For example, one way to create this file would be to run:

    (umask 0077 && echo MY_SECRET_TOKEN > ~/.gist)

The `umask` ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account.

### GitHub Enterprise

If you'd like `gist` to use your locally installed [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/),
you need to export the `GITHUB_URL` environment variable (usually done in your `~/.bashrc`).

    export GITHUB_URL=http://github.internal.example.com/

Once you've done this and restarted your terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`), gist will
automatically use GitHub Enterprise instead of the public github.com

Your token for GitHub Enterprise will be stored in `.gist.<protocol>.<server.name>[.<port>]` (e.g.
`~/.gist.http.github.internal.example.com` for the `GITHUB_URL` example above) instead of `~/.gist`.

If you have multiple servers or use Enterprise and public GitHub often, you can work around this by creating scripts
that set the env var and then run `gist`. Keep in mind that to use the public GitHub you must unset the env var. Just
setting it to the public URL will not work. Use `unset GITHUB_URL`

### Token file format

If you cannot use passwords, as most Enterprise installations do, you can generate the token via the web interface
and then simply save the string in the correct file. Avoid line breaks or you might see:

    $ gist -l
    Error: Bad credentials

# Library

* You can also use Gist as a library from inside your ruby code:

    Gist.gist("Look.at(:my => 'awesome').code")

If you need more advanced features you can also pass:

* `:access_token` to authenticate using OAuth2 (default is `File.read("~/.gist")).
* `:filename` to change the syntax highlighting (default is `a.rb`).
* `:public` if you want your gist to have a guessable url.
* `:description` to add a description to your gist.
* `:update` to update an existing gist (can be a URL or an id).
* `:copy` to copy the resulting URL to the clipboard (default is false).
* `:open` to open the resulting URL in a browser (default is false).

NOTE: The access_token must have the `gist` scope and may also require the `user:email` scope.

* If you want to upload multiple files in the same gist, you can:

    Gist.multi_gist("a.rb" => "Foo.bar", "a.py" => "Foo.bar")

* If you'd rather use gist's builtin access_token, then you can force the user
  to obtain one by calling:

    Gist.login!

This will take them through the process of obtaining an OAuth2 token, and storing it
in `~/.gist`, where it can later be read by `Gist.gist`

## Configuration

* If you'd like `-o` or `-c` to be the default when you use the gist executable, add an
alias to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent). For example:

    alias gist='gist -c'

* If you'd prefer gist to open a different browser, then you can export the BROWSER
environment variable:

    export BROWSER=google-chrome

If clipboard or browser integration don't work on your platform, please file a bug or
(more ideally) a pull request.

If you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the internet, export the `HTTP_PROXY` or
`http_proxy` environment variable and gist will use it.
