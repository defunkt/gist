gist(1) -- gist on the command line
===================================

## SYNOPSIS

`gist` [`-p`] [`-t extension`] <FILE>

## DESCRIPTION

`gist` can be used to create gists on gist.github.com from the command
line. There are two primary methods of creating gists.

If standard input is supplied, it will be used as the content of the
new gist. If <FILE> is provided, the content of that file will be used
to create the gist.

Once your gist is successfully created, the URL will be copied to your
clipboard. If you are on OS X, `gist` will open the gist in your
browser, too.

## OPTIONS

`gist`'s default mode of operation is to read content from standard
input and create a public, text gist from it, tied to your GitHub
account if you user and token are provided (see `CONFIGURATION`).

These options can be used to change this behavior:

  * `-p`, `--private`:
    Create a private gist instead of a public gist.

  * `-t`, `--type`:
    Set the file extension explicitly. Passing a type of `rb` ensure
    the gist is created as a Ruby file.

You may additionally ask for help:

  * `-h`, `--help`:
    Print help.

  * `-m`, `--man`:
    Display this man page.

## CONFIGURATION

Use git-config(1) to display the currently configured GitHub username:

    $ git config --global github.user

Or, set the GitHub username with:

    $ git config --global github.user <username>

See <http://github.com/guides/local-github-config> for more
information.

`gist` will check the `HTTP_PROXY` env variable if supplied:

    $ HTTP_PROXY=http://host:port/ gist script.py

## EXAMPLES

    $ gist < file.txt
    $ echo secret | gist --private
    $ echo "puts :hi" | gist -t rb
    $ gist script.py
