gist(1) -- gist on the command line
===================================

## SYNOPSIS

`gist` [`-p`] [`-t extension`] <FILE|->

`gist` -r <ID>

## DESCRIPTION

`gist` can be used to create gists on gist.github.com from the command
line. There are two primary methods of creating gists.

If standard input is supplied, it will be used as the content of the
new gist. If <FILE> is provided, the content of that file will be used
to create the gist. If <FILE> is '-' then gist will wait for content
from standard input.

Once your gist is successfully created, the URL will be copied to your
clipboard. If you are on OS X, `gist` will open the gist in your
browser, too.

You can also get gists by id.

## OPTIONS

`gist`'s default mode of operation is to read content from standard
input and create a public, text gist from it, tied to your GitHub
account if you user and token are provided (see `CONFIGURATION`).

These options can be used to change this behavior:

  * `-p`, `--private`:
    Create a private gist instead of a public gist.

  * `-t`, `--type`:
    Set the file extension explicitly. Passing a type of `rb` ensure
    the gist is created as a Ruby file.

  * `-o`, `--[no-]open`:
    Open the gist in your browser after creation. Or don't. Defaults
    to --open

You may additionally ask for help:

  * `-h`, `--help`:
    Print help.

  * `-m`, `--man`:
    Display this man page.

Or get a gist by id:

  * `-r`, `--returns`:
    Returns a gist by id.

## AUTHENTICATION

There are two ways to set GitHub user and token info:

  * Using env vars GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_TOKEN

    $ export GITHUB_USER=johndoe  
    $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=mysecretgithubtoken  
    $ gist ~/example  

  * Using git-config(1)

Use git-config(1) to display the currently configured GitHub username:

    $ git config --global github.user

Or, set the GitHub username with:

    $ git config --global github.user <username>

See <http://github.com/guides/local-github-config> for more
information.

## CONFIGURATION

You can set a few options in your git config (using git-config(1)) to
control the default behavior of gist(1).

* gist.private - boolean (yes or no) - Determines whether to make a gist
  private by default

* gist.extension - string - Default extension for gists you create.

* gist.browse - boolean (yes or no) - Whether to open the gist in your
  browser after creation. Default: yes

## ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect the execution of `gist`:

* HTTP_PROXY - Proxy to use when Gisting. Should be "http://host:port/"

## EXAMPLES

    $ gist < file.txt
    $ echo secret | gist --private
    $ echo "puts :hi" | gist -t rb
    $ gist script.py
    $ gist -
    the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    ^D

    $ gist -r 738124
    // Ceci est un test!
    // Hello World!
